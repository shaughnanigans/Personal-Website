#### Task

The Calgary Craft Beer Club founder wants a website to showcase their Meetup group. The site, with the support of headless CMS, offers a blog page to display articles and posts about craft beer related content, an events page listing upcoming events (integrated with the Meetup API) and a contact form for people to get in touch.
