#### Task

The Grand Theatre London was looking for a better customer-experience with their ticket-purchasing process. The team was tasked with revamping the website while integrating Tessitura in order to increase online ticket sales for shows at the theatre. I was involved with some of the front-end work, such as the navigation and the footer.
