#### Task

JB is a local craftsman that builds skillfully crafted garden boxes that are one of a kind and built from scratch. He is looking for a website to showcase the steps and materials it takes to build a box. The website will have a FAQ section, a contact form to get in touch or to request a quote and a gallery page with images from past projects. Built with the support of Headless CMS to update content.
