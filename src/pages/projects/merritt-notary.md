#### Task

My client is a Notary who has recently opened a new firm. I was tasked with building a website outlining the services the firm offers, the firm's address, hours of operation, methods of contact, and a contact form. This was a great experience not only for web development, but for design and marketing. I created their logo and letterhead using Figma and designed the website myself as well. I also assisted with the setup of Google My Business to help them engage with future customers.
