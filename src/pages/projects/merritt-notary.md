#### Task

I was tasked with building a website for a notary based in Merritt, BC, that had recently opened a new firm and needed a new website outlining the services the firm offers, the firm's address, hours of operation, methods of contact, contact form, and SEO. I also created their logo and letterhead using Figma. I assisted with the setup of Google My Business to help them engage with future customers.
