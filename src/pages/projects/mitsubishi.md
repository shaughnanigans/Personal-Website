#### Task

Mitsubishi Motors North America is the USA website for looking up latest car models and news. The task was to update the design of the site with SEO guides. I worked with the design and SEO teams to create new components and re-design already-existing ones to use on pages to be more modular, responsive, and engaging to users. As a result, the site was top-ranked in JD Power 2020 Manufacturer Website Evaluation Study.
