#### Task

Nissan USA is the official sites to customize, explore, and shop full vehicle lineups. 
Websites should be inclusive and accessible. With the help of Deque resources, Nissan has adopted WCAG 2.1 level A & AA compliance standards. I was part of a team dedicated to maintaining and integrating accessibility practices. As a result, I have learned a lot about accessibility and inclusive design and it is something I am passionate about striving to do better.
