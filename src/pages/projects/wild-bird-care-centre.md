#### Task

A website near and dear to me and deserves a special mention. It was the first website I had done in industry during my time as a co-op. Wild Bird Care Centre is based in Ottawa, Ontario and is a bird sanctuary that is dedicated to the rehabilitation of orphaned, injured, and ill wild birds. I was tasked with giving the site a complete overhaul...that was several years ago now and has since been replaced.
